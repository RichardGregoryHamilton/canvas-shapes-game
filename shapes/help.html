    <p>This is an arcade-style game where you are presented with a shape. Your objective is to determine which shape appears
    on the screen</p>
    
    <div id='exp-rectangle'></div>
    <p>The above shape is a rectangle, so you would click on the rectangle button</p>
    
    <div id='exp-circle'></div>
    <p>The above shape is a circle, so you would click on the circle button</p>
    
    <p>
      As you level up, you will be presented with many different shapes. This only adds to the challenge as you have to quickly
      determine what shape shows up. At high levels, you will need lightning fast hand-eye coordination.

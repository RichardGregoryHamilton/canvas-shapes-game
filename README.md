# How to play
* Shapes are randomly displayed on an HTML5 canvas board. Either a circle or a rectangle will be displayed.
* Your objective is to select which shape was displayed before time runs out.
* At the start, you have 5 seconds to select a shape
* This might seem easy, but as you level up, you get less and less time to select an answer
* Also, shapes are given randomly selected colors. This might confuse you.
